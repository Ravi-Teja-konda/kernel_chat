## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### Serial Console Connection
```bash
# Connect to your embedded device
/serial connect /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

### Send commands naturally

#### **`~` Natural Language Queries**  
- **What it does:** Converts your plain English questions into appropriate Linux commands  
- **AI Processing:** Automatically generates commands, sends them to your device, and provides intelligent summaries  
- **Best for:** Quick diagnostics, system analysis, and getting insights without knowing exact commands  

Examples:
```bash
   ~ Check the dmesg and summarize
   ~ What processes are consuming the most memory?
   ~ Show me network interface status
```

#### **`>` Direct Shell Commands**  
- **What it does:** Sends commands directly to your connected device  
- **Raw Output:** Shows exact command output without AI interpretation  
- **Best for:** Specific commands, debugging, and when you need control  

Examples:

```bash
    >uptime
    >free -h
    >lsusb
    >journalctl -f
```

#### **`>>>` Analysis & Summaries**  
- **What it does:** Analyzes recent output captured from your device without sending new commands  
- **AI Analysis:** Reviews logs and data already collected, providing insights and explanations  
- **Best for:** Understanding what happened, pattern analysis, and getting context about previous output

#### **Combined Usage: `'>' command >>> analysis`**  

Examples:

```bash
   >dmesg >>> summarize for errors
   >ps aux >>> which processes are using too much memory?
   >lsusb >>> are all USB devices working properly?
   >cat /var/log/syslog >>> what happened in the last boot?
```

### Device Analysis (tool calling)
```bash
# Get comprehensive device information
> get device info
```
This tool will call the `get_device_info` tool which provides:

- **System Identity Overview:** High-level "at-a-glance" summary of your Linux system's hardware and software configuration  
- **Hardware Information:** Device model, CPU architecture, and platform details for compatibility assessment  
- **Software Stack Details:** Kernel version, Linux distribution, and user-space environment information  
- **Initial System Assessment:** Quick orientation tool for understanding what you're working with before deep debugging  

```bash
# Analyze real-time performance
> analyze real-time performance on this system
```

This tool will call the `real_time_analysis` tool which provides:

- **RT Kernel Analysis:** Checks real-time kernel configuration, preemption settings, and boot parameters  
- **Interrupt & Scheduling Analysis:** Examines IRQ handling, RT task priorities, and CPU affinity settings  
- **Performance Diagnostics:** Identifies latency sources, priority inversions, and timing issues  
- **System Configuration Review:** Analyzes CPU isolation, power management, and memory settings affecting RT performance  
- **Hardware & Network RT Features:** Reviews CPU features, network stack configuration


```bash
# Check for kernel performance bottlenecks and interrupt issues
> get me the kernel hotspots connected to serial
```

This  will call the `kernel_hotspots` tool which provides:

- **CPU Utilization Analysis:** Shows how busy the processor was during a 5-second monitoring window  
- **Time Distribution Breakdown:** Details how CPU time was split between user space, kernel space, interrupts, and deferred work  
- **Performance Profiling:** Identifies the exact kernel functions consuming the most CPU time (when perf is available)  
- **Interrupt Analysis:** Shows the most frequent hardware interrupts and their rates  
- **System Health Assessment:** Provides a "medical check-up" for your Linux kernel's performance  

**What This Helps You Debug:**

- **Performance Issues:** Identify if CPU overload is causing system problems
- **Driver Problems:** Spot kernel functions that might be stuck in loops or consuming excessive resources  
- **Hardware Malfunctions:** Detect interrupt storms or abnormal hardware behavior
- **System Bottlenecks:** Understand where your kernel is spending its processing time
- **Resource Contention:** See if specific subsystems (network, I2C, timers) are overactive


```bash
> Get driver info from the serial device
```
This tool calls the `get_driver_info` tool which provides:

**Key Information:**
- **Overview:** High-level summary of how many devices were inspected  
- **Device Count:** Total hardware devices detected by the kernel  
- **Binding Status:** How many devices have drivers loaded vs. unbound  
- **Health Check:** Overall assessment of your hardware driver situation  


### Documentation Q&A with RAG
```bash
# Ingest documentation
/rag add linux-6.14.11/Documentation/devicetree --tag kernel
/rag add am335x_manual.pdf --tag beaglebone

# Ask complex technical questions
/ask "How do I configure GPIO interrupts on AM335x with proper device tree bindings?" --tag kernel
/ask "What are the power domain considerations for GPIO performance on BeagleBone Black?" --tag <tag you created>
```

### Natural Language Debugging
```bash
# Real-world problem solving
> My GPIO switching is only 1MHz instead of 10MHz on BeagleBone Black, what could be wrong?

> I'm getting kernel panics during high CPU load with GPIO operations, help me debug this

> Design a real-time system for motor control with sub-100μs response time on BeagleBone Black
```

### Code Generation Examples (With support from Gemini CLI)
```bash
# Driver development
> Create a Linux kernel driver for an SPI-connected accelerometer sensor

> Generate a device tree overlay for BeagleBone Black with I2C sensor at address 0x48

> Write a GPIO interrupt handler for BeagleBone Black with proper error handling

# System configuration
> Generate a kernel config for real-time BeagleBone Black system with PRU support

> Create a Makefile for building a custom kernel module with cross-compilation

> Write initialization scripts for embedded Linux system startup
